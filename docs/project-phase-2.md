# DAW Project #

## Phase 2 requirements

Create an user interface for the _project issue management system_, running in the browser and using exclusively the HTTP API developed for phase 1 (except for loading static content such as HTML, javascript and images).
If required, the HTTP API can be improved.

* The user interface should allow the usage of the complete functionality exposed by the HTTP API.
* All operations should require user authentication, using a same-site HTTP-only cookie, instead of HTTP Basic authentication.
  * The HTTP API should be added with resources to set and delete the authentication cookie, as well as to retrieve the authentication status.
  * The user interface should include a login screen and a logout action.
* Support for browser navigation, bookmarking, and deep-linking is highly valued.
* Support for the API evolvability via hypermedia support on the client is highly valued.

## Delivery

* This phase 2 must be delivered until ~June 11 (end of week 14)~ June 15 (middle of week 15) via the creation of a `0.2.0` tag on the GitHub repository.
